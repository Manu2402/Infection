# Infection
Infection is a simple graphical and physical representation of a simulation of a context in which, within a community, one of the individuals has been infected with a virus. The individuals in this community are colored balls, and can result in three different states:
- Green: uninfected
- Yellow: infection risk
- Red: infected

When an infected individual is near an uninfected individual, the latter enters the “infection risk” state, and after a few seconds of close contact, it will be infected.

This project, conducted as an exam in the first year of the "Video Game Programming" course at AIV (Accademia Italiana dei Videogiochi), aims to show the acquisition and application of two of this year's most important concepts: 
- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Physics (Collisions and Newtonian Physics)
